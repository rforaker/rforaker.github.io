For this project I attempted to create a password generator.

On this one I struggled pretty hard with local vs global scoped variables, but I think I eventually got the hang of it.

I wasn't able to get all of the parameters for the password generator to work, the method I tried to use was maybe a little too complex, or I was overthinking it.
I tried to basically create an empty array, then 4 seperate arrays, each a parameter for the password generator. Then, as the user works through the prompts,
if they select "Ok" it would concatenate values of the given array into the master password character set. I can't figure out the logic doesn't seem to work to get it to set up the characterset properly.
